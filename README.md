# DefectDetectionML
Use machine learning/computer vision to detect defects in images.

This is a project based on data provided by Fraunhofer Inspection Planning Research Group, which requires machine learning techniques to detect defects in real and simulated gears and springs.

Plan of action:
1. Use existing machine learning models for each of the tasks.
2. Use sklearn to assess performance measures.
3. This will be the base line.
4. Expand on results using re-training or transfer learning technqiues. (will I need to pay for Google Cloud time for this? No other access to GPU right now.)
5. Test ensemble learning. Combine classical image processing feature extraction into a wide-and-deep network. (Probably not enough time to reach this stage.)

Questions:
How to view stl images?

what sets the real and synthetic images apart?
why are ones more difficult to predict than the others?
how you chose a model to be trained?
general incentive during development?
