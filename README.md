This is a project based on data provided by Fraunhofer Inspection Planning Research Group, which requires machine learning techniques to detect defects in real and simulated gears and springs.

The results are discussed in the file: Report v2.0.pdf

The code is found in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/yseen/DefectDetectionML

Images and machine learning models, which are too large for GitHub, are found on Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lv5D7ow5bDk-c-KUXALmsILn5TppZjx6?usp=sharing
